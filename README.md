# Artless Hockey

A procedurally-rendered 2D hockey game built in Unity 6.0 LTS — with no sprites or models. All visuals are driven by code.

That's where it came the name "art-less" and hockey because it's a hockey game.

I hope you enjoy the game, the objective is pretty simple, make a satisfying, optimized and simple game that works on all devices without network, ads and it's open-source!
